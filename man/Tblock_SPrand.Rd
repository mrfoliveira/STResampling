}
\arguments{
\item{data}{full dataset}

\item{nfolds}{number of folds}

\item{t.nfolds}{number of folds across time. Default is sqrt(\code{nfolds})}

\item{sp.nfolds}{number of folds across space. Default is sqrt(\code{nfolds})}

\item{time}{column name of time-stamp in \code{data}. 
Default is "time"}

\item{site_id}{column name of location identifier in \code{data}. 
Default is "site"}
}
\value{
A list with slots:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}, possibly re-ordered
\item \code{f}, a vector with the fold numbers 
(from \code{1} to \code{nfolds}) of each row in \code{data}
}
}

\itemize{
\item blocked time
\item randomly assigned locations
}
